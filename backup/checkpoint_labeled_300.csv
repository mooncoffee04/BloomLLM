She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it.

The writers had to write a letter to their local newspaper in which they stated their opinion on the effects computers have on people.,"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?",10,1,Create,5,"The question requires students to produce a new piece of writing (a letter) expressing their opinion, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room?

One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life.

As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," Laughter is huge part of life. Or so that is what I believe and grew up with. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day."" @CAPS1 quote has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life.  My mother is quite the entertainer. People have told her that she should become a comedian. Apparently our family stories are very amusing. Mostly because they involve my brother in some way or another. He's adventurous, spontaneous, and is not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions are not the smartest. A majority of the stories my mom talks about are from when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular.   When my brother was younger he liked to take part in adrenaline based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, biking, and skateboarding. He would try to do every trick in the book and then some. @CAPS1 story, however, does not include him getting hurt or someone else getting hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would injure himself or his best friend @CAPS2.  When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at age eleven or twelve, we were at one of my soccer games. My brother had to use the bathroom and when he came back, my mom was not pleased. He went to use the port-o-potty and he had just gotten two new shirts; a white t-shirt to go under a new button-up. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept on the button-up. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it into the rancid, disgusting excrement. If @CAPS4 ask him, it was all an accident and my mom was not happy about it.  My mom is the person in the family who thoroughly enjoys laughter. I think about her words of wisdom all the time, ""@CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think of the positives in your life and laugh. Because really, that's all @CAPS4 can do. If @CAPS4 embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people @CAPS4 need to laugh it off. If @CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if anyone else does."" @CAPS4 need to get through life somehow. Might as well make it the best, and laughter is truly the best. It makes my mood better, and makes me feel welcome and at home.    There are many stories about what my brother did, or how blond I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. ""A day without laughing is a waste of a day.""

One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there.",3,6,Analyze,5,"The question requires students to identify and explain the difficulties faced by the builders, which involves breaking down the situation into its component parts and examining their relationships."

The writers had to write a letter to their local newspaper in which they stated their opinion on the effects computers have on people.,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept.

The writers had to read an extract from *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon Lusted. They then had to answer a question about the difficulties faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there.,"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws.",4,6,Analyze,5,"The question requires students to identify and explain the difficulties faced by the builders, which involves breaking down the information and examining the relationships between different factors."
The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered. There isn't a particular audience that visits a library. Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audiences interest and they will go eslewhere. Now that doesnt mean that offensive materials are acceptable and here is why.     There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity, and action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such needs to have conditions.Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some @CAPS1 from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore would'nt be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were availible only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem.     Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes books they can be placed in areas availible to epople who enjoy it. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies is a form of entertainment that is strongly advertsied over magazines and books. Any advertisement that show explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was inteded for.      If @CAPS1 wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well. @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, @CAPS1 over the age of @NUM1 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be seperated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appualing. Listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well. If there is a song that isnt preferable to a certain audience or it offends someone headphones should be a requirement. The library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless. This can potentially eleminate the problem as long as the headphones themsleves are at an appropriate level. If @CAPS1 want to check out any materials that is or can be offensive or explicit in some way  they must prove their age of maturity, due to some items with slight violence being availible to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1.     In conclusion, if the categorization of harmful or explicit materials is placed properly and out of view of unwanted viewers or children this can eleminate the issue. Music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume. No items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced. With rules and conditions the library can be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.",4,2,Create,5,"The question asks students to write a persuasive essay, which involves generating new content and expressing personal views, aligning with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

They then had to describe the mood created by the author with supporting evidence from the extract.,"The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example it told the boy that you don't have to be a blood realative. For instance, the author states ""@CAPS1 up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". Another reason, was that you should always help your family s during bad times. For example the book reads ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporilily until they were able to get back on their feet"". Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance the auother quotes ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.",3,5,Analyze,5,"The question requires students to break down the text, identify specific elements (mood), and support their claims with evidence, which aligns with the Analyze level."

""The Steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.""

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"Should someones work catagorized as 'inappropiate' or 'offensive' be taken off of a shelf and not able to be sold or seen in stores? If you believe so, then do you think it is okay for the campaigners that run for @CAPS1 be able to express their thoughts and opinions on different topics? This is exactly what is being done when someone writes an article or a book that they have published to be distributed into stores or libraries.     When someone writes a book on something, they usually have a lot of interest in whatever topic they are discussing. Just as when @CAPS2 campaigners present themselves to the public and announce what party they will be running for and what their beliefs and disbeliefs are. If it is okay for someone to take a book off of a shelf, or even a magazine because people think the book is 'inappropiate' then maybe we should reconsider what the campaigners say on live @CAPS3.      Even if you were to walk into a store and there be nude magazines on the shelf, or cd's with lyrics that contain cuss words do you feel those should be taken off of shelves as well? There is a time and a place for where things like this should not be displayed. For example, when you go to a little kids store and things like this are being sat out for the kids to see, they will not forget what they saw or heard if referring to music. Kids have a great memory on things that should not be remembered. Like when they read a story and it includes someone robbing a bank, or a song that refers to drinking or doing some form of drug. When kids see or even hear things like this, they are more likely to try things that we would hope little kids would not try.     When someone spends months or even years on writing a story, they hope that they can get it published and be rewarded for their long, hard work. By doing this they try and get it to be published, and put in stores so people can buy it. Whether or not if your talking about music, movies, or books, its all the same. Things should be put out on display and people should be able to see all the different types of music and stories that are available.      If things were going to be taken off of shelves or not put out onto display, people will stop recording music, acting out movies, or even writing ad's and books. When and if this were to happen, people will not become educated with new available data. If there is nobody to write science books, or biography's then nobody will learn about new things. Same with music and movies, if people spend a few months or even a year writing a new album, or coming up with an idea for a movie and they work hard to get it done, they expect to get it out to the public. If its finally out and people have the chance to buy it, they hope it will stay available. If it doesn't and people think the movie is 'inappropiate' then the song writers and actors will more then likely not have the urge to do it all over again.     In conclusion, I think that if someone writes something or records something that has taken them a good amount of work and time that they should be rewarded and allowed to have their item sold. If someone belives that an item is 'inappropiate' then they should keep their comments to themselves, and not have the item taken off display. There are some people out there that enjoy things that are not 'appropiate' and they think its funny. Surely if the write or producer got a book or movie produced they thought it was good, and they believe that people will buy their product. So, if the writer thinks this, surely there is someone out there that feels the same. How are we to know if there is someone out there that agrees, and enjoys the book or movie if it has been taken off of the shelf because someone thought the material was 'inappropiate.'",5,2,Create,5,"The question asks students to write a persuasive essay, which requires them to generate new content and express their own views, aligning with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

The writers had to write a letter to their local newspaper in which they stated their opinion on the effects computers have on people.,"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor. Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Now is the time to decide if you should support computors. The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work.

The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that.     First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article. But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world.     Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point.     Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her. And now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world. This is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important.      Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world.

She was saying the way she doesn't want to be at home because he mom don't let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend.

When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If  picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive.

Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as LÃ¼sted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights.

People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward themself by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says ""@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically.

First thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. @CAPS3 me personally like books that have violance and graphic language in them @CAPS3 that just makes the book so much more interesting. And when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. And @CAPS1 boadcasters need to watch what they put on the air @CAPS3 some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch.      The second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. I dont think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violance or hearing words that are graphic. But its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. @CAPS3 it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that.     And its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to. @CAPS3 there is more cerse words in the @DATE1 than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazies. Magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to picures.me myself dont really look at magazines @CAPS3 they dont really intrest me I would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on @CAPS1.     Then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids. I think the libraries shoul have different rooms that have different types of book in them. @CAPS3 if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. They should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphis pictures or that just are not suitable for children.      That is why I think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. Kids dont need to know bad language at their age @CAPS3 that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them.

Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast.Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating, that airships cannot fly to close to urban areas.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library.   First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life.   Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read.    Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group.   Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing.   In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf",3,2,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a new piece of writing (a persuasive essay) that reflects their personal views, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."
Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of ""speech giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today @CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional @CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS5 up (@CAPS2't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @CAPS5 to serve the purpose of a television. @CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the ""actors."" @CAPS3 the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, @CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS4 laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS5 is required to clap. @CAPS4 clap was different, @CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""@CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening."" @CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended @CAPS5, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. @CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @CAPS4 was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting.",40,8,Create,5,"The question asks the user to generate a new narrative, which requires synthesizing elements and producing an original piece of writing."
Write a story in which laughter plays a part.,"Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing.

Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else.",4,2,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a persuasive essay, which involves synthesizing information and expressing original viewpoints, aligning with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

If it wasn't so hot, then he wouldn't of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship.

We laughed about me being stupid and getting hurt for it and we laughed about @CAPS1 big ears and how they make him look like @CAPS2 the elephant.  I think what makes us so close and such good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating one of my friends and the first thing I did was make her laugh and ever since then we have been awesome friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest fest, with her and I did and a made her laugh the whole time. Now I'm her dork and she is my best friend. The biggest thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest fest, was when I did a wheelie in the tractor down the whole track with a cowboy hat on and a huge dip of @LOCATION1 in my lip.

The writers had to write a letter to their local newspaper in which they stated their opinion on the effects computers have on people.,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.",10,1,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a new piece of writing (a letter) expressing an opinion, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

If we want to comunicate with people from around the world to send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can use computers to do that. We can chang people's lifes in third world countries with the help of computers. Computers can also help us in school. When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it. Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer. Maybe a kid forgot his homework, he can go to his school website and find it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the worker(s) can use the computer and bring up the back-up file. When they need to order supplies, most times they will go to a web site and order online. Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company, an e-mail is sent out and is found using a computer.

So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them?

They do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Family's and @CAPS1's are spending less time together because they have computers to talk to each other. Computer's have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live. It keeps us healthy. With all the fast food places pople need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A staticstic is @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each have their own computer in the house. They said ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside"" (@PERSON2 @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1). Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Human only have so long to live. There is beautiful nature outside. We do not enjoy our surrounding because we would rather be on th computer. For example @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature every week. A young girl about @NUM6 never apperciated nature until her parents made her stay in a month. She now loves nature. because it got boaring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be apart of our big events. Because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just ""go with it"" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just ""go with it"" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?",40,8,Create,5,"This question requires the learner to generate a new narrative, integrating a specific element (laughter) into its structure and development."

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles would try to dock, they sometimes could not even get close to the building because of the strong winds By having the dirigibles hanging over pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was considered unpractical and unsafe.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," ""@PERSON1, @CAPS1 up! It's almost time you to go to school!""  @CAPS2 mom yelled at fuzzy hair, half-opened eyes, and yawing boy. That's me. Today is a first day of @CAPS2 first new middle school. Our family moved to a new place, that's why I had to move a school too. I woke up and took a shower and wore @CAPS2 school uniforms with exciting and nervous mind, because I didn't know anyone from @CAPS6 new school. When I arrived to the school, students who are same age as me started to scream out loud for sadness of school days that are coming up or excitement of meeting their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused because of these hyper students and the new school. I shook @CAPS2 head off and started to concentrate finding @CAPS2 classroom. '@CAPS3 hah! There it is.' @CAPS4, I found @CAPS2 classroom and when I stepped in, @CAPS5 looked at me curiously for a while, since I was the ""new"" kid to @CAPS6 school. I sat alone and waited for teacher to come. During I was waiting, I put @CAPS2 head down and slept a little bit with no smile on @CAPS2 face. Suddenly, teacher opened the door and spoke loudly, ""@CAPS5 sit down and be quiet!"" @CAPS6 teacher must be the most strict teacher I've never seen. While teacher was writing down something on the whiteboard, the students were trash-talking about the first sight of the teacher. It was terrible for yelling at the student when you saw for the first time. For example, I knew a kid who went to a private school and transferred to a public school. I had a same class with him and I was his partner. Since I didn't know him very well, I started to ask questions about him. At first, he answered back nicely to me and I thought, 'We could be close friends from @CAPS6 class.' @CAPS7 it was wrong. He started to talk loud to me when teacher was explaining something to us and it got me into trouble for talking with him. Other students hated him for being distracted during class and he often asked useless questions to the teacher really loudly. Also, he had weirdest perfume smell that he thought it was cool to wear. @CAPS5 thought he was annoying which caused to a small fight. @CAPS8 arguing with other friends, he stopped coming school and now we don't even know where he is at. Like @CAPS6, it shows that the first sight is really important to have in relationships with other people. When I heard that the first sight is really important from other students who were sitting behind me, it changed @CAPS2 mind to an open mind such as having a smile on @CAPS2 face. I though, ' I shouldn't be like that kind of teacher's first sight. Maybe I should change @CAPS2 face looking with smiling and some confidence on it.' @CAPS8 that class, I started to put smile on @CAPS2 face and thought positively. I tried to be participate for the class and worked hard for making new friends in the new school. Therefore, the other student opened their mind as well and started to ask things about me. For example, it was like these questions; 'why did you come to @CAPS6 school?', 'what sports do you like most?', 'what game do you play?', and etc. From those aggressive questions, laughter can change @CAPS2 looking and make good relationships. How did I know? When I first entered to @CAPS2 classroom with concerning face on it, @CAPS5 just stared at me and looked like they didn't want to know about me. @CAPS8 putting laughter on @CAPS2 face, they started to feel comfortable than the first time. Changing me depressed face was @CAPS2 starting point in the new school. I started to make a lot of friends which it became a way for me to be a class leader. I felt really amazing and awesome that how ""the new guy"" can be the leader of @CAPS6 class. I felt proud of myself and thought of happiness that I actually started to have laughter on @CAPS2 face since the teacher didn't look good without a laughter.",34,8,Create,5,"This question requires the student to generate a new narrative, integrating a specific element (laughter) into the story.

People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place?

Lastly, people in todays day in age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really reading one. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online.

In the excerpt the author tells how many dirigibles use hydrogen which is very flammable.  That makes it very dangerous to dock them on the Empire State Building because they could get in an accident, and since New York is so densely populated it would probably harm many people.  People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible.  Another problem builders face was nature.  In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""  This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable.  According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe.  To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.

If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people @MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful.

As I watch them slowly grow out of their unusual habits, I find myself back @CAPS4 the year @DATE1. A little girl, not in school yet, runs in her grandmother's yard on a @DATE4's mid day.

I let the little ones have a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they wouldn't give me another chance @CAPS4 see. I pushed @CAPS7 way through. All three of us looking through something so small. We kept giggling, and talking. We did this for about @CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @CAPS8 minutes.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," I don't think people today laugh enough. Laughing is said to be one of the healthiest things out there. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I believe laughing really is healthy for you.  I have a friend who's really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to make the pain go away. If I could cheer her up @NUM1 I'd be happy to do so. Yesterday her and I were together and I can't remember what we were talking about but it must of been good because she got me to laugh to hard that I threw up! I know that doesn't sound very fun, but even as I was coming up from doing that we were both still laughing. Times like that I can definitely look back and smile on. I love the effect laughter has on people. I've been sitting down at a bus stop and giggling or laughing for absolutely no reason and the people next to me will start laughing! That only makes me laugh harder then everyone's doing it! Also as long as you're with friends, or anyone for that matter, and you can laugh, that means you're having fun and enjoy each others company. I don't see the point in being friends with someone who can't at least make you giggle a bit.  The other day me and my friend were sitting in the car, it was dark, quiet and we were just talking. Out of no where my mom pops up saying, ""@CAPS1!"" (this always happens though.) @CAPS2 did we scream our lungs out. I guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other only to start laughing hysterically at how silly that was.  Laughter really does bring people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you're laughing with someone you're usually laughing for the same reason, right? Just as my friend and I were in the car.

You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster.

One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One @MONEY1 the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook.Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper.

The writers had to write a letter to their local newspaper in which they stated their opinion on the effects computers have on people.,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted.       Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar.  We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.       Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself.  '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  In any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose",5,2,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a new piece of writing (a persuasive essay) that reflects their own views, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are a uncontrolable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist.

Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly.

"Write a story about a time when you, or someone you know, was patient.","Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you're quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you're waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren't doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you've lost, and you've enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened I've experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you're patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn't a bundle of roses"" all the time, so soon or later, you're going to need to use patience.

To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four : a mother, a father, and two daughters in @CAPS1. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee, and loud music the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for it's snow. @ORGANIZATION1. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with @ORGANIZATION1's weather. This was around a decade ago, so the enviroment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool @DATE1 day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that @DATE1, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's @CAPS1, along with our cats in their cages. After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, @LOCATION2. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectaular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always being in our memories! Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in @LOCATION2 in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight seeing... a total drag!! It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to @LOCATION2, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area. I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so I started to sing in my tone deaf way. Since I was so young, my voice cracked midway through the song we were listening to, which caused in uproar of laughter! My mother started to say that I was simply adorable, and my father started to mock me. My sister started to sing, too, and before you knew it, everyone was singing along! Spirits were high, and everyone was having fun singing, and laughing. We started being more active after that, too! The rest of the trip down south was full of energy, and both time and distance passed quickly.

It helps people @CAPS2 things such as allow people to talk to each other, goin skills from playing games, and it has images and it is easier. As I ,mentioned, computers allow us to communicate with other people. This way, we don't have to talk to people in person. it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers. those would be either getting trouble at school, memorizing a phone number and the dialing it, or talking to than in person. Clearly, computers make it easier to talk to people. Next, computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family. You could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat. This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in @LOCATION1 and just recently sent an e-mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people, no matter how far. Secondly, every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game, whether it be by a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many skills. The first skill we could learn is typing. just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you had @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as you can, as fast as you can. If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time. It also gets harder as you go, getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on. Also, a class that at @CAPS4. information processing, is about computer. Once we were finished with our assignments, we could play type to learn @NUM2. That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of games where you need guide-thinking to be able to win. This teaches nto be ready for almost anything. Also, it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision. In real-life situations you @MONTH1 only have a few seconds to react. Games such as these help in real-life situations. The last type of game is the tower defense. This shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it. If we were to evr join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our trops in the best mannor we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to bag upgrades buy @LOCATION1 towers. One decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit. Tower defense games make us make better decisions. Games @MONTH1 be fun, but they teach us skills too. Lastly, computer make things easier and have images on @ORGANIZATION2.

The writers had to write a letter to their local newspaper in which they stated their opinion on the effects computers have on people.,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! My second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can effect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! Everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family? So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?",10,1,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a new piece of writing (a letter) expressing an opinion, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."
The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"Censorship          Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is. If it is something very provacative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed. Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials.          I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted. Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents. If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate. Sometimes the guardians views @MONTH1 not be the same as a the library or schools, but it's mostly up to the guardian. Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence.           Over all, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board memebers, and/or library staff. Just because one mom thinks a book is innapropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person.                If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it. If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others @MONTH1 not agree. Materials considered innapropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban.",4,2,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a new piece of writing (a persuasive essay) that reflects their own views, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."

I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in town with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will tribute to better research. Most @CAPS2 dont have textbooks about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 at home with them so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class a parket, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet I don't know how long it would have taken.

Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, the next in a losh, steamy, jungle thriving with animals...All without leaving your room!

Who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2.

Family is a very important factor in computers because if you havent seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life. If thats not the case you can meet new people. By meeting new people you have more connections in your life and more people to trust. Learning! Learning is a good thing for adults an children. Computers can teach children by showing them new words, colors shapes and sizes. For an adult it can show them meanings of words or new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be round on a computer all by learning. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you also physical like coordination. You can improve your coordination by making you stronger when you type. Your hands are a big thing in like and they are helpful in a lot of ways.

""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the Building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval.     The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi @LOCATION1. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader.     The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it.     Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what seperates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's.     Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.",4,2,Create,5,"The question requires students to generate a new piece of writing (a persuasive essay) that reflects their personal views, demonstrating the creation of original work."

The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.," Laughter? What is laughter? Well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. My @CAPS5 has five days of laughter as I call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @LOCATION2, the @DATE1 of @DATE1, @CAPS2 , and @CAPS3. On my birthday the whole @CAPS5 gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day I was brought into this world. Usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  When @LOCATION2 finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @CAPS5 meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. Which we always seem to miss at least one every year. While we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. When we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. Then watching him try to climb down again. When that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. Which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. On the @DATE1 every one has their own agenda that they fallow. My dad and me go to @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 to light @CAPS6 on the third of @DATE1 for @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. Then on the @DATE1 my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  Then comes my favorite laughing day @CAPS2. My dad sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. When we go trick or treating I am usually a solider with a @CAPS8 gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though I am right beside them. Later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, I usually win because I get to stay out later than my siblings do. Well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @CAPS3! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. We all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when I am cooking. After every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. Then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. Its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. That is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time.

I didn't know but I saw in his hand. @CAPS6 hasa deck of card. I noticed it right away that @CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game, which is very fun to play when I was @NUM1..., I wanted to ask him if @CAPS6 wanted to play the card game yu-gi-oh but I was too nervous to ask him, after church ended and @CAPS2 parents and I went home the day passed by. The next morning I had to get ready for @CAPS2 first day in school in @LOCATION1, it was kinda hard since I am going to be in that new school with no friends but once I got their I notice something right away i saw that same kid from yesterday I was kinda surprise since @CAPS6'd go to the same church as me. After @CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I took a seat, @CAPS2 teacher begin roll call saying each students in are class name, each students replied and said ""here!"" when it came to that other kids turn his name was @PERSON1,once class started it went by kinda fast when you are busy doing class work so once lunch started I went to have lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in @CAPS2 class are nice to me they asked if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked but that one kid @PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @CAPS6 was mad at me later on after school before I gotten on the bus to go home I saw that @PERSON1 kid again so I ran to him and asked if @CAPS6 liked playing yu-gi-oh? @CAPS6 ""replied yea what bout you?"" I ""told em yea we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes"" @CAPS6 said we could play this @DATE1 at church.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.,"@CAPS1 as long as you breathe, love as long as you live. @CAPS2 was impossible, there was absolutely no way @CAPS2 could be real. Breathing seemed virtually unachievable, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me blurred, spinning viciously as I clung to the fresh cut grass. Tears diluted the burn in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, though neither caused my body to tremble as @CAPS2 did. Attempted screams came out as muffled moans. Alone @CAPS8 helpless, I could feel her staring at me, unsure of what to @CAPS7. My best friend stood @CAPS8 watched as I grew more violent, pounding the dew soaked lawn with my fists, whimpers transforming into shrieks. A door slammed behind me @CAPS8 I felt the arms of my father, trying to guide me towards the house. Once inside, my dad buried my face in his chest in more of an attempt to silence my obnoxious wailing rather than comfort me. He apologized repeatedly, I imagine he didn't know what else to @CAPS7. @CAPS2 was too early for the In a better place"" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as stumbled up the stairs to my bedroom, @PERSON2 trailing close behind. Sitting on my bed @CAPS2 seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was over-whelmed by the feeling I was missing something, like he was closer than I knew. I sat up to see his plastic sunglasses sat staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @CAPS8 his ""stunna-shades"" danced through my head. Him standing out the car sunroof flexing shirtless, to propping himself up pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind, his face held grief @CAPS8 frustration, he didn't want me crying. The few times tears fell down my face he'd say, ""@CAPS3 on, suck @CAPS2 up @CAPS8 take @CAPS2 like a man!"" I knew in my heart he wanted me to be with the people he loved @CAPS8 he wanted us to be smiling. With the morning sun beating on my back, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Reaching her front porch, I realized immediately the time I was about to spend in that house, would be like none before. When I let myself in as I always did @CAPS6 peered around the corner, eyes swollen @CAPS8 discolored. I took four steps forward @CAPS8 met her with a tearful embrace, in which I apprehended @CAPS6 wished I was him. @CAPS6 loved him in a way I'd never fathomed, but the desperate longing to be held by a loved one, I knew all too well. We cried @CAPS8 held each other because there was nothing more we could @CAPS7. When there was a pause in the sobs @CAPS8 @PERSON3 actually looked at me for the first time, noticing I looked just as terrible as @CAPS6 did. I reached into my pocket @CAPS8 pulled out his sunglasses. @CAPS2 was hard not be selfish at a time where all I wanted was to be comforted, but I knew what I had to @CAPS7. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @CAPS2 was my next step. Her gaze drifted down to the palms of my hands. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5."" @CAPS6 started weeping once more, I held her @CAPS8 tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, tear stained @CAPS8 reddened as well. I smiled at them gently. They all took notice to the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they hadn't know him the way @CAPS6 @CAPS8 I did. We spent the day gathered around with a loss of words @CAPS8 hunger, our pizza sat untouched, the television on just to break the silence. No one said much, about anything. ""@CAPS7 you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?"" I felt the question @CAPS3 up like vomit, too large to swallow. They just looked at me, not sure what to think. I feared I spoke too soon, I began to assume all of the melancholy @CAPS8 crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted for longer than @CAPS2 had. @PERSON3 smiled @CAPS8 nodded to my relief. ""@CAPS8 you got mad because he kept putting the nuts in your noodles."" I laughed aloud, I couldn't help @CAPS2. I was flooded by the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. ""@CAPS7 you remember how he'd always braid your hair?"" @PERSON3 smiled even greater.  The rest of that month was filled to the brim with tears, but @CAPS2 overflowed with laughter. When @PERSON1 died, laughing was the last thing I wanted to @CAPS7. @PERSON1 always generated the larger portion of my laughter, @CAPS8 with him gone I never imagined I would @CAPS1 again. But in reality, just because he left too soon doesn't mean the laughter did.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class.     Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it.     People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors.      Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson.     Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme. secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research.

You can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members, by email etc. When your online you can learn alot of things. If your at home, and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might be bored, so they can go online and play games and have fun. People, especially kids get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivias so they can still learn. Computers can let you interact with your family and f riends.

With a good understanding of what the majority of people would call innapropriate, evaluating what books should be placed on the shelfs is easier.

With a rating system of books, movies, magazines, and other materials in a library, parents would have a better understanding of what they want their child to read or watch. If there is vulgar language inside of the book, it could be labeled with a rating and an explanation of why the book is rated the way it is. That way, if there are complaints of the item, the library would not be blamed.      I personally don't think that getting rid of materials because of others' complaints should occur. I believe that the books could be kept, but labeled or even placed on a different section of shelves to reference that they @MONTH1 be more innapropriate than the normal.

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.

When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building which cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. Wind proved to be another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas.",4,6,Analyze,5,"The question requires students to identify and explain the difficulties faced by the builders, which involves breaking down the information and examining relationships between different factors."

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"Freedom of press is a right not many countries have. America is the land of the free. To some, having this much freedom causes great things to happen. Without the freedom of press, many of the most classic modern literature would not exist and their messages would be unknown. To censorize the right to write freely about ones outlook on the world or government or anything means taking away imagination and in some cases statistics and events that relate to the past.     Before todays technology, books were one of the only ways to obtain knowledge, and the process to make and publish a book took so long that it was an honor to recieve one of the few copies produced. People have a craving for information, they like to learn and advance. If all books that were found 'offensive' are stripped off the shelves, information is slowly taken away and the enjoyment of reading would be gone.      In the brilliant novel, @CAPS1 @NUM1 a man who lives in a distopian society discovers the lack of literature. All books found in homes are immediatly taken out and burned in the streets for all to see. Children found it entertaining and adults did nothing. The man goes through the novel with a secret stash of books of his own. Once discovered he is on the run to protect his precious knowledge the government tries so hard to keep from the public. Censorship would create nothing but chaos and distruction as in the novel.      Having the right to know about your countries history or what is going on in your current government is critical in shools and colleges. Parents often find offense in the authors schools choose to make students read, saying their ideas and ways of thinking are to single minded and wrong. Students need books to grow and learn and if every person chose one book to take off the shelf perminatly, there would be no more books. Eventually all information would come from what one would know before the books were banished and in time gone for good.      Books are a history in themselves, no one wants to hear the raw truth of certain topics such as slavory or the possibility of a complete government take over. In order to avoid hearing of this one could simply chose a more ficition novel in which to escape into a fantasy of their own. No one can change history, however they can exagorate certain events and without the actual book or cite it came from, one could completely alter the publics view and thoughts of the past. Should one take offense to a certain book, they have their own freedom to write a negative blog or report on it.      Writing is a gift few have naturally and to be able to show off ones talent is a privlage. Books help people escape the harsh world we live in, or help them gain more knowledge. Censorship is irrevelent, for having all forms of music, movies and magazines stripped of the truth, what does that leave? People always strech the truth or tell a 'white lie' however most information is factual. The freedom to write and make books and music and movies is not all about entertaining people.

First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society.

The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts.

There are card games, board games, even @NUM1 games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. You @MONTH1 learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way be for us. There is still much we dont know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. The computer can also teach you hand-eye. Hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as there online. Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous.

Pretty soon, my laughter diminishes, my smile lowers, and my lips began to quiver. It feels as though my heart is bleeding, and being squeezed at the same time. The eyes are becoming moist, they began to sting, and reden as if infected. Do not ask me if I am okay, ask to do anything for me, or hug me.

Write a story in which laughter plays a part.,"                               Trippin' on fences I am @NUM1 years young, and in those short @NUM1 years, all I can ever remember, is laughing hysterically. Whether it was about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". With my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 and I, that's exactly the case. I always get a good ab workout whenever I'm with her, because I'm always bursting with laughter. It was my @NUM3 grade year at @ORGANIZATION1 here in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans I'd just gotten the day before, at @LOCATION2. I was also telling her about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for sometime, this boy had also asked me out on the note. @ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it over to her, all of a sudden, she chucked the note over the fence. Clearly, the guy didn't have @ORGANIZATION2's approval. I couldn't just leave the guy hanging without an answer, especially when at the time, I liked him back. I begged @ORGANIZATION2 to give me my note back, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just let an unanswered note lay on the other side of the fence? No. The only solution was to hop over the fence and grab it. So I, in my new jeans might I add, practically straddled the fence, and ripped a big hole on the inner side of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so mad. I grabbed the note, and climbed back over the fence in my new and improved hobo jeans. On my way back over, I lost my balance, and fell of the fence. I ended up losing the note again and planting head first into a pile of mud and pine cones.  What an idiot I was, I'd climbed over that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, biffed it and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself, I started laughing. I'm not sure if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started cracking up. Then @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laughter is so contagious. Pretty soon, we were both hysterically laughing like a couple of dorks. ""Laughter really was the shortest distance between two people"" that day. Even though I probably should have been mad.... But why do that when @CAPS1 can just laugh about it? That's what life is all about, living. With this silly but funny memory, it'll stay with me forever. Especially now that @ORGANIZATION2 has moved away. It @MONTH1 seem stupid, but it was funny to us. I guess it really was one of those ""@CAPS1 had to be there"" kind of moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @CAPS1 don't, your life can almost feel dull without it.

Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chating, and instant messaging. Some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @CAPS1 people, when they type, look at the keyboard. But, with pratice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 for fun: They type @ORGANIZATION2 in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I deffinately think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finially, people can look a person or place up using the internet.

First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event!

You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an .

The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,"I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now. If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to. But they should'nt be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it.            If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed.           Movies are a whole different thing then books. They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling. Then again its just my opinion. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem.           Music is'nt that bad. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books.     Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties.      This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there @MONTH1 be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice",3,2,Create,5,"This question requires students to generate original content (a persuasive essay) reflecting their personal views, which aligns with the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."
The writers had to read an extract from *The Mooring Mast* by Marcia Amidon Lusted. They then had to answer a question about the difficulties faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there.,"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought.",3,6,Analyze,5,"The question requires the reader to identify and explain the difficulties faced by the builders, which involves breaking down the information and examining the relationships between different factors."
The writers had to write a persuasive essay reflecting their views on censorship in libraries.,I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right,2,2,Create,5,"The question asks students to 'write a persuasive essay reflecting their views,' which requires them to generate original content and express their own ideas, fitting the 'Create' level of Bloom's Taxonomy."
