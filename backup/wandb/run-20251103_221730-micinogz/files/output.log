The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.
No label_names provided for model class `PeftModelForCausalLM`. Since `PeftModel` hides base models input arguments, if label_names is not given, label_names can't be set automatically within `Trainer`. Note that empty label_names list will be used instead.

`use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing. Setting `use_cache=False`.
/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/torch/_dynamo/eval_frame.py:745: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. In version 2.5 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
