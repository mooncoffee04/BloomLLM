The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.
No label_names provided for model class `PeftModelForCausalLM`. Since `PeftModel` hides base models input arguments, if label_names is not given, label_names can't be set automatically within `Trainer`. Note that empty label_names list will be used instead.
